# PPP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PPP is to download and assemble a unified, cleaned data set of 
Paycheck Protection Program loans issued in 2020.

The data is too large to share on GitHub, but this package will allow you to
recreate the data locally.

The work for this package grew out of a project with [DataKind's DC chapter](https://github.com/DataKind-DC/CARES) and 
the [National Press Foundation](https://nationalpress.org/).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kbmorales/PPP")
```

## Assembling PPP data

``` r
# Note: this function will download over 600MB of data to your local machine,
# and read a large dataframe into memory!
ppp_data = ppp_assemble()
```
